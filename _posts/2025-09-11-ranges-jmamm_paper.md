The first Ranges peer-reviewed publication has been published!

[**Extending mammal specimens with the essential phenotypic traits**](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jmammal/gyaf062/8214011?login=false){:target="_blank"} is now available for your pleasure in the Journal of Mammalogy. Dr. Jessica Light and the Ranges Network are featured in a news article in Texa A&M's AgriLife Magazine! DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyaf062

We offer our gratitude to the army of authors, those remarkable Rangers, and all of the good folks at JMamm (reviewers included) for making this publication possible.

### Abstract
Natural history collections are repositories of biodiversity specimens that provide critical infrastructure for studies of mammals. Over the past 3 decades, digitization of collections has opened up the temporal and spatial properties of specimens, stimulating new data sharing, use, and training across the biodiversity sciences. These digital records are the cornerstones of an “extended specimen network,” in which the diverse data derived from specimens become digital, linked, and openly accessible for science and policy. However, still missing from most digital occurrences of mammals are their morphological, reproductive, and life-history traits. Unlocking this information will advance mammalogy, establish richer faunal baselines in an era of rapid environmental change, and contextualize other types of specimen-derived information toward new knowledge and discovery. Here, we present the Ranges Digitization Network (Ranges), a community effort to digitize specimen-level traits from all terrestrial mammals of western North America, append them to digital records, publish them openly in community repositories, and make them interoperable with complimentary data streams. Ranges is a consortium of 23 institutions with an initial focus on non-marine mammal species (both native and introduced) occurring in western Canada, the western United States, and Mexico. The project will establish trait data standards and informatics workflows that can be extended to other regions, taxa, and traits. Reconnecting mammalogists, museum professionals, and researchers for a new era of collections digitization will catalyze advances in mammalogy and create a community-curated trait resource for training and engagement with global conservation initiatives.
