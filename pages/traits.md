## Why Traits?

Traits are the morphological, reproductive, physiological and behavioral properties of organisms. These characteristics are important for biodiversity research, monitoring, and educational initiatives because they form the interface between individuals and their environment. Traits allow researchers to:
- link trait variation to environments, ecological contexts, and time;
- analyze distributions of trait values and develop richer models of trait evolution;
- cross-validate the species-level trait data currently held in community trait databases;
- rapidly update understanding of trait variation within lineages as taxon concepts are continually revised.

## Ranges Trait List

Ranges has identified the following traits as essential for the success of this project. This list is likely to evolve during the life of the project. This not a comprehensive list of all measurable mammal traits.
